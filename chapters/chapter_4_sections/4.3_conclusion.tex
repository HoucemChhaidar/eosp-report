This chapter detailed the final two sprints of Release 2 for the Credix payment system. Sprint 3 implemented comprehensive credit management where Super Admins distribute bulk credit to Admins after cash payment at ASM, and Admins distribute credit across end users. Sprint 4 enhanced the platform with analytics capabilities, providing Admins with powerful insights into transaction patterns and credit usage. Together, these iterations deliver a mature payment platform with robust credit management and analytical capabilities.
