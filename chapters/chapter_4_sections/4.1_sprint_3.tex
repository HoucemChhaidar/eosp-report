\subsection{Use Case Diagram}

Figure~\ref{fig:uc_sprint3} presents the three major use cases developed during Sprint 3: purchasing bulk credit, distributing credit across end users, and monitoring end user transactions. It illustrates their respective interactions with the \textit{Corporate} actor and the authentication system.

\subsection{Realization (Sprint 3)}

In this section, we present the main interfaces developed during Sprint 3, dedicated to credit management functionality. This work involved implementing bulk credit purchasing, credit distribution systems, and transaction monitoring capabilities. Each interface is illustrated with screenshots and accompanied by descriptions of functionality and user journey.

\subsubsection{Bulk credit purchase interface}

The bulk credit purchase interface guides corporate users through the credit purchasing process with email verification and admin approval.

\textbf{Credit Purchase Form:}

Figure \ref{fig:credit_purchase_form} illustrates the credit purchase form, the initial step of the bulk credit acquisition process.
