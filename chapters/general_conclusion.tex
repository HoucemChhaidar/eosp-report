At the end of this project, we have a complete Credix digital payment management platform, designed and developed using Agile Scrum methodology. From Release 1, the foundations were established with the implementation of secure authentication (JWT), fine-grained role management (Super Admin, Admin, End User) and microservices architecture, as well as a credit management system for inter-company transactions.\par 

Release 2 enriched these building blocks with the integration of a hierarchical credit distribution system where Super Admins distribute bulk credit to Admins after cash payment at ASM, the implementation of automated credit distribution from Admins to end users, and the addition of advanced transaction monitoring. In parallel, an analytics system provides complete visibility on payment flows and expenses. Finally, the entire system was industrialized through CI/CD pipelines: Jenkins orchestrates the generation and publication of React/Node.js artifacts, Docker ensures containerization and automated deployment of microservices, while PostgreSQL and cloud services guarantee data persistence and scalability. This modular and scalable architecture meets performance, security and traceability requirements, while offering a smooth and responsive user experience.\par

For the future, opening up to new payment methods, enriching predictive analytics functionalities and extending to other business sectors constitute many avenues to make Credix an increasingly intelligent solution centered on business needs.
