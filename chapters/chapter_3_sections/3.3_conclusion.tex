The first release of the Credix mobile payment application, structured across two comprehensive sprints, has successfully established the foundational infrastructure for a secure barcode-based payment platform. Sprint 1 focused on robust authentication mechanisms with a three-tier role hierarchy (Super Admin, Admin, End User) and comprehensive user management capabilities, while Sprint 2 introduced transaction management with wallet balance viewing, transaction history, store listings, time-bound barcode generation, and real-time transaction confirmation. The implemented features include web application interfaces for authentication, role-based dashboards, wallet management, transaction processing, and store discovery. This release validates the Credix platform's innovative approach and positions it as a competitive solution in the mobile payment market.
