    \item Achieve comprehensive unit test coverage for critical business logic and core functionalities.
    \item Provide comprehensive API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI) and detailed deployment guides to ensure ease of maintenance and onboarding for new developers.
    \item Implement automated integration and end-to-end tests to ensure the seamless interaction between different system components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability (UX/UI)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a clear, accessible, and responsive interface that adapts seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
    \item Adhere to established ergonomic standards, ensuring intuitive navigation, minimal cognitive load, and a consistent user experience across all modules.
    \item Utilize a modern and professional design aesthetic, with fluid transitions and interactions between different application sections, enhancing user satisfaction for all user roles.
