This chapter provided a comprehensive analysis of the Credix credit management system requirements and design foundations. We identified the key application actors - SUPER\_ADMIN, ADMIN, and END\_USER - and their specific roles within the hierarchical system ecosystem. The functional requirements were structured around our sprint-based development approach, emphasizing credit distribution capabilities and analytics features that form the core of Credix's value proposition.

We established the technological foundation with carefully selected tools including Angular for web interfaces, Spring Boot for backend services, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. The non-functional requirements ensure security and maintainability standards necessary for a credit management platform.

The global use case analysis revealed the comprehensive scope of Credix, showcasing the interconnected functionalities across four development sprints. From basic end user management and wallet operations to advanced hierarchical credit distribution and financial reporting, the use case diagram demonstrates how authentication serves as the foundation for all system interactions.

The next chapter will focus on the detailed design and implementation of Release 1, covering the initial sprints that establish the core infrastructure and basic functionalities of the Credix platform.
